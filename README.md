## ⚙️ Technical Highlights

- Full OOP design using classes, inheritance, and encapsulation
- All utility functions (e.g., string manipulation, validation, date parsing) are self-implemented
- File-based persistence using `fstream`
- Custom `split()` and `join()` logic with flexible separators
- Bitwise operations for permissions (`bit & mask`)
- Consistent screen layout and interface by inheriting from a base screen class
- Clean and readable codebase (no code repetition)
